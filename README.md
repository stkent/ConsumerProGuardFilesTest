# ConsumerProGuardFilesTest

Example repository used to test whether consumer ProGuard files defined by transitive dependencies are used when ProGuarding a consuming application.

# Project Structure

The project contains an Android application module (app) and two Android library modules (library1 and library2). Both libraries contain a single class and a `proguard-rules.pro` ProGuard file that protects this class from minification and obfuscation. Both libraries expose this rules file via the `consumerProguardFiles` property. According to the [Android Gradle plugin documentation](http://google.github.io/android-gradle-dsl/current/com.android.build.gradle.internal.dsl.ProductFlavor.html#com.android.build.gradle.internal.dsl.ProductFlavor:consumerProguardFiles), this property represents:

> ProGuard rule files to be included in the published AAR.
> 
> These proguard rule files will then be used by any application project that consumes the AAR (if ProGuard is enabled).

# Experiments

## Verifying behavior with two explicit dependencies

- Checkout the `app_depends_on_both_libraries_explicitly` branch.

On this branch, app dependencies are declared as follows:

```groovy
dependencies {
    compile project(':library1')
    compile project(':library2')
}
```

and neither library1 nor library2 declare any dependencies.

- Execute the command `./gradlew clean`
- Execute the command `./gradlew app:assembleDebug` (running these commands separately avoids some directory sync issues)
- Open the generated file located at `app/build/outputs/mapping/seeds.txt`

This file contains a list of classes and methods that were not obfuscated.

- Observe that the following classes were not obfuscated:
	- com.github.stkent.library1.TestClass1
	- com.github.stkent.library2.TestClass2

## Verifying behavior with one explicit and one implicit dependency

- Checkout the `app_depends_on_library1_explicitly_and_library2_implicitly` branch.

On this branch, app dependencies are declared as follows:

```groovy
dependencies {
    compile project(':library1')
}
```

library1 dependencies are declared as follows:

```groovy
dependencies {
    compile project(':library2')
}
```

and library2 declares no dependencies.

- Execute the command `./gradlew clean`
- Execute the command `./gradlew app:assembleDebug`
- Open the generated file located at `app/build/outputs/mapping/seeds.txt`
- Observe that the following classes were still not obfuscated:
	- com.github.stkent.library1.TestClass1
	- com.github.stkent.library2.TestClass2

# Conclusion

Based on the fact that `TestClass2` is protected from obfuscation when declared as an implicit dependency of the app module only, it would appear that ProGuard configuration set via the `consumerProguardFiles` is respected for transitive dependencies of Android applications. A further test can confirm that `consumerProguardFiles` is playing a key role here:

- Checkout the `app_depends_on_library1_explicitly_and_library2_implicitly` branch.

On this branch, app dependencies are declared as follows:

```groovy
dependencies {
    compile project(':library1')
}
```

library1 dependencies are declared as follows:

```groovy
dependencies {
    compile project(':library2')
}
```

and library2 declares no dependencies.

- Comment out the line `consumerProguardFiles 'proguard-rules.pro'` from the `library2` `build.gradle` file.
- Execute the command `./gradlew clean`
- Execute the command `./gradlew app:assembleDebug`
- Open the generated file located at `app/build/outputs/mapping/seeds.txt`
- Observe that the following class was not obfuscated:
	- com.github.stkent.library1.TestClass1
- Observe that the following class was obfuscated:
	- com.github.stkent.library2.TestClass2
